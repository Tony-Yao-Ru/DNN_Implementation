## üß™ Modules

### 1. `DeepNeuralNetwork.py`
The core module containing the implementation of the DNN class.  
This class encompasses methods for:
- Initializing the network architecture
- Forward propagation
- Backward propagation
- Training the model
- Evaluating performance

### 2. `driver_MNIST.py`
A script designed to train and evaluate the DNN on the MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digits.  
It demonstrates the network's capability to perform image classification tasks.

### 3. `driver_XOR.py`
A script that showcases the DNN's ability to solve the XOR problem, a classic example in neural network training.  
It highlights the network's capacity to learn non-linear decision boundaries.
